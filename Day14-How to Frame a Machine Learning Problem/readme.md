## Introduction to Framing the Problem

An overview of how to define and structure a business problem for machine learning, setting the foundation for the project.

## Case Study: Netflix Churn Rate

Explores a real-world example of customer churn using Netflix, highlighting key factors and challenges in predicting churn.

## Converting Business Problem to ML Problem

Details the process of translating a business objective (e.g., reducing churn) into a well-defined machine learning problem.

## Types of Problem

Discusses the types of machine learning problems (e.g., classification, regression) relevant to churn prediction.

## Current Solution

Reviews the existing approach or baseline solution for addressing churn, including its strengths and limitations.

## Getting Data

Describes the data collection process, including sources, features, and considerations for quality and relevance.

## Metrics to Measure

Outlines key performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, AUC) to evaluate the success of the churn prediction model.

## Online vs. Batch Processing

Compares online (real-time) and batch processing approaches for deploying the churn prediction model.

## Checking Assumptions

Explains the importance of validating assumptions made during problem formulation and model development.
